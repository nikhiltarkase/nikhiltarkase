Nikhil Tarkase
I’m a 27 year old Unix System Administrator with four+ years of experience. Specialising in Unix, Redhat, Linux.

Over the years I have found a love for Unix Administrator and making clients easy to use and accessible to everyone.

I’m currently working at Softenger , as a team leader. Over the past few years, I’ve had the privilege to work on some fantastic preople in the industry. 

However, when I’m not behind in the backend servers, you could find me either chillaxing or on a Youtube binge.

Feel free to contact me here.
